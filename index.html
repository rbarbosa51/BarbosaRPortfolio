        <p>
            <span class="tabIndent"></span>You are viewing my profile. Thank You for your time. I hope to show you why I am your best candidate. I am bilingual (Spanish)
            so I can code your websites in both Spanish and English. This will allow your web development company to tab into a larger
            marketplace. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="tabIndent"></span>I am a Military Veteran. I served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. By hiring me, your company may be elegible for some tax incentives 
            from both State and Federal Governments. That also implies that I am VERY GOOD UNDER PRESSURE!!! You can expect that by hiring me 
            your productivity can only go up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="tabIndent"></span>I am also the self-published author of the book: Blender 3.3 Geometry Nodes By Tutorials: A tutorial based approach to learning Blenderâ€™s Geometry Nodes
